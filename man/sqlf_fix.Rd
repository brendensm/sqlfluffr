\arguments{
\item{sql}{A SQL string to fix.}

\item{file}{Path to a SQL file to fix.}

\item{dialect}{SQL dialect (e.g. `"ansi"`, `"bigquery"`, `"postgres"`).}

\item{rules}{Character vector of rule codes to apply.}

\item{exclude_rules}{Character vector of rule codes to skip.}

\item{config}{A [sqlf_config()] object.}

\item{glue}{If `TRUE`, treat `\{var\}` placeholders as `glue::glue_sql`
variables and preserve them in the fixed output.}

\item{force}{If `TRUE` and `file` was provided, overwrite the file with
fixed SQL. If `FALSE` (default), the fixed SQL is returned without
modifying the file.}
}
\value{
The fixed SQL string (invisibly if the file was overwritten).

Automatically fixes style and syntax violations in a SQL string or file

\section{Common parsing issues}{

sqlfluff cannot fix SQL that fails to parse. When this happens, the
original SQL is returned unchanged and a warning is issued. Common
causes include:

\itemize{
  \item Missing parentheses after IN: use `WHERE x IN (1)` not
    `WHERE x IN 1`.
  \item "IS NOT IN" syntax: use `WHERE x NOT IN (...)` instead of
    `WHERE x IS NOT IN (...)`.
  \item Glue placeholders without `glue = TRUE`: if your SQL contains
    `\{var\}` placeholders from [glue::glue_sql()], pass `glue = TRUE`
    so sqlfluff treats them as template variables rather than syntax errors.
}
